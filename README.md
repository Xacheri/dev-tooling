# dev-tooling
A repositiory of configuration and install scripts for my favorite dev toolings.

## NeoVim
I have been using NeoVim as a default text editor. The ability to stay on the keyboard and install and tweak it to contain only the features I desire is invaluable. 

This config is kept in it's own repository [here](https://github.com/Xacheri/neovim-config)

I am doing my best to make it cross-plaform between unix and windows, so it is more transferable than some of the tools here.

## zsh
The zsh folder contains the terminal profile I use, in the form of my ~/.zshrc file
and the install script (for ubuntu) and them install script

## tmux
my ~/.tmux.conf file is contained in this folder and just sets my preferred tmux bindings
